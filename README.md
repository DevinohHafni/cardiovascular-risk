# Nail Image Analysis Using Multi-Task CNNs for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment

This project aims to extract visual indicators from nail images that correlate with cardiovascular risk factors using multi-task deep learning.

## Features
- Multi-task learning: Nail color classification + nail morphology/pathology detection
- Preprocessing pipelines for nail images
- Experimental notebooks for exploration and training
- Modular code for easy extension

## Dataset
See `dataset_plan.md` for details on labels, sources, and ethics.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DevinohHafni/cardiovascular-risk.git
